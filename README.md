## About The Project

The project was made to learn about how to use generative AI models with Python, and how to create a very simple
to use interface to interact with the model. Other useful skills can be gathered, such as how to use Git,
a templating engine, how to write ~good documentation and how to containerize the application to make it
available to everyone easily.
