# Home Image Generator

## About The Project

The project was made to learn about how to use generative AI models with Python, and how to create a very simple
to use interface to interact with the model. Other useful skills can be gathered, such as how to use Git,
a templating engine, how to write ~good documentation and how to containerize the application to make it
available to everyone easily.

## Working Environment

To setup the developer environment, you need `poetry` to be installed on the system. There are several ways
to get it, for further information, check [this site](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

To install the Python dependencies, just run `poetry install` and you are good to go. It is highly recommended
to use a Python virtual environment.

## Run The Application

To run the application use the `python3 home_image_generator/main.py`. To see all the options, use the `--help` flag.
